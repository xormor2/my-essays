My essay: On the topic of metaphysics and physics:

KARMA, GOOD AND EVIL, GODS AND DEVILS:
I would claim there is something called "karma" (the Hindu word that has its Buddhist counterpart "dharma") and the devils and the gods (of every religion there was, is and will be) are within the human psyche (the soul) - as social functions (as the collective spirit).

THE NATURE, THE UNIVERSE:
The nature is not controlled by anything supernatural, nor a single entity. Everything is just a sum of "work" - everything is a product and can serve different interests; take for example "fossil fuels" and "sunlight" and "water" and "oxygen" as natural resources used by human beings and various other groups of animals and plants. I think that evolution holds true as a fact, and as a scientific explanation of how the Universe works - the Universe develops into living entities.

THE POSSIBILITY OF A MULTIVERSE:
There might even be a Multiverse, containing all possible variations in the changes that happen or could have happened in the Universe. The Multiverse would contain all the individual possible Universes. The Universe is philosophically more an Abrahamic faith theory of existence of the world - one God, one fate, one world; and the Multiverse would be more of a Dharmic (with the idea of karma, known as "dharma" in Buddhism) faith theory of the existence of the world. There is the microcosm and the macrocosm: quantum fields, electro-magnetism etc, nuclear forces, gravity -- the movement and transformation of energy.
