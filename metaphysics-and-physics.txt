About metaphysics and physics:
I would claim there is something called "karma" and the devils and the gods are within the human psyche - as social functions. The nature is not controlled by anything supernatural, nor a single entity. Everything is just a sum of "work" - everything is a product and can serve different interests. Take for example "fossil fuels" and "sunlight" and "water" and "oxygen". I think that evolution holds true as a fact, and as a scientific explanation of how the Universe works - it develops into entities. There is the microcosm and the macrocosm: quantum fields, electro-magnetism etc, nuclear forces, gravity -- the movement and transformation of energy.
