This is a short essay I wrote about Middle Eastern religions
(Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Paganism (yes - Paganism originated in
the Middle East, believe it or not, Christianity (birth of Christ)
and Islam (an Abrahamic religion with its roots in the Arabic world)
about Christmastime ("Yuletide", "jultid", "joulun aika"):

THE ASTROLOGY IN ZOROASTRIANISM:

Interestingly enough there is astrology in Zoroastrianism, as supposedly is or
at least was in Hinduism. Zoroastrians had a god, called "Tishtrya" that is
the Northern Star - "Tish"="Taivas" and "Trya" is "Tyr" (one-handed
Scandinavian-Germanic god), and "Tir" (Persian name for "arrow", the "archer
in the sky", the sky-star-god). It would be "Taivaannuoli" in Finnish, and the
equivalent for it in Finnic Paganry and Shamanism is "Taivaannaula"
("the Nail of the Sky"), aka "Pohjant√§hti" ("The Northern Star"). Zoroastrianism
competed with Vedaism that became Hinduism later.

THE THREE WISE MEN OF THE BEGINNING THE NEW TESTAMENT OF THE BIBLE, BIRTH OF
JESUS:

I had a Christian book that claimed that the Three
Wise Men who came to Bethelehem to behold the birth of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth were Zoroastrian astrologers - Zoroastrian mages, that competed with
the religion "Judaism" that still exists to these days, especially in Israel,
the nation-state of the Jewish folk/people.

ABOUT THE RELIGION CALLED "ISLAM" AND ITS VARIOUS SECTS:

Islam is on the other hand a religion that has spread all over the world,
as has Christianity, and thereare lots of sects in Islam. The main ones being:
"Sunna" and "Shia". There is also something called Sufism, and then there is
Alawite Islam, and those also are dispersed into various cults and sects, of
which Salafism (a part of Sunni Islam) is one, and Wahhabism can also be
considered a part of Salafism.
